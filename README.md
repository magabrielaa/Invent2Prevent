# Invent2Prevent

I programmed a dashboard with data visualizations on hate crimes target at people with disabilities. The visualizations where embedded into a website for our team's submission to the Department of Homeland Security and McCain Institute's [Invent to Prevent competition](https://www.mccaininstitute.org/programs/preventing-targeted-violence/invent2prevent/).

Here is a look of the dashboard:
